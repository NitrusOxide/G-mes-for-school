# Minecraft
We all need a little minecraft. Don't we? Let us all work together so we can get Minecraft unblocked.


There are so many website blocking sites and apps out there. At my school, Relay Classroom is the one  we all need to work around.
I've heard of GoGaurdian, but I'm not sure about it. (If anyone would like to email me about it, here is my email: ab2117@student.piedmontschools.org.) I would like some information about it, though. I know a crap ton about Relay Classroom, if anyone needs the refresher. Can anyone help? I'm only new to HTML5 and that's if I can remember the basics of that language of code. I'm young, below 21. My point to that is, I really need help. 


So, what does every one say to this repository?

Last thing, please don't feel the need to give me any form of money besides cash. I don't have any form of electronic payment methods. Thanks!

Let's do this, y'all.
